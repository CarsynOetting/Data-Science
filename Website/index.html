            <h2>About me!</h2>
            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>October 11th, 1994. A day that will live forever in infamy, for it was the day that I was unleashed upon this world. Born in Mountian View California, I relocated to Louisville, CO in the late 1990's where I spent most of my childhood. After a two year stint in Cut Bank MT, I returned to Colordao where I finished middle school and attended high school (Go Shazbots!). I attened Montana State University, initially I pursued a degree in Civil Engineering, but later switched to Family and Consumer Sciences which more closely aligned with my personal interests.</p>
